        <p>When I surfing on the internet, I am so curious about the structure of the web which looks so beautiful and fantastic. You can’t imagine how magic it is when your idea come out with a web. I discovered that I could achieve the look I was going for if I edited the HTML instead. I became fascinated the ability a web developer has to be imaginative, artistic and technical, while developing a product that benefits and inspires others.</p>

        <p>I become a tennis beginner after I saw the Australian Open in 2020(By clicking the following picture,you can watch the excellent game). It is a really good sport which a large amount of people caring about it. It is really hard for me to learn tennis due I have experiences on badminton. I always hit the ball with badminton style which is really bad for the tennis. So, there is a long way for me to hold it. Though I am sure I could.If you want to learn how to play tennis as well, let's play together.</p>

        <p>You can’t imagine how happy it is as you are building your fish tank, just like build an apartment for the fish. You have to plant some carpet plant for the fish tank. Then you must consider the recycle water system for it, and most important thing is you have to separate the baby fish with their mother which might eat them after they producing them. In a word, it is interesting and amazing.</p>
