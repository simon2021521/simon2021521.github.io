            <h3>My Reasons</h3>
            <p class="p">Iâ€™ve always had an interest in this career or type of job from university, while I have started my career in a different field, but a few years later I ended up liking this new area more. Maybe I read about how software is changing the world, and I decided to major in Information Technology and become a programmer, and the same time I have a good friend who encouraged me to get into it, and I found that I like it a lot.

            <h3>My Aspirations</h3>
            <p class="p"><span>Learning is really important to me.</span> I want to continue learning techniques that will make me a better leader and researcher. As I mature as a professional- I hope to take over a leadership role for the next generation of analytical researchers at the company. Eventually I would love to take my researching skills to the application side of the business. For me- making that move indicates I will be able to use everything I learned throughout my education and career to make new innovations.
